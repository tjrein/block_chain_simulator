Installation and Usage Instructions

1) Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.
2) From the root project directory, run the command `docker-compose up`
3) This will build two images and setup two containers with all the requisite dependencies.
4) Once the `client` container finishes building the react application, the `server` container will serve the project.
5) The project will be accessible at `localhost:5000`
